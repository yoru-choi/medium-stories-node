# My Tech Blog

This repository contains the source files for my blog posts. I use **Markdown** for writing posts, and the content is published on **Medium**.

## Purpose

1. To version control my blog posts using Git.
2. To maintain posts in an easily readable and developer-friendly format.
3. To share my knowledge in a clear and organized way.

## How I Write

- All posts are written in **Markdown** and stored in this repository.
- Code snippets are included directly in Markdown with proper formatting.
- For any posts requiring detailed code highlighting, I provide links to the relevant **GitHub repositories**.

## Publishing

- Once a post is ready, I publish it to my Medium blog.
