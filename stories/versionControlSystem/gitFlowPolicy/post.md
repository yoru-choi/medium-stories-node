The reason for adopting the Git-flow strategy
As the number of team members continued to grow, we recognized the need to establish a version control strategy in advance.

Therefore, we decided to familiarize ourselves with Git-flow early on to accelerate the learning curve and ensure a smooth adoption in the future.
