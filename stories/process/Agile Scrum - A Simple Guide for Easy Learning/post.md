![Scrum Workflow](https://qlqjs674.notion.site/image/attachment%3A18ab098e-eb11-4b3f-a64b-7b322b59be00%3Aagile_scrum-scrumWorkFlowForImage.png?table=block&id=1cf930ff-582f-8000-abe7-c07bb81399f0&spaceId=6ab3efe6-44b5-4e5c-9d86-56543fb7f59d&width=1420&userId=&cache=v2)

The Scrum workflow typically follows these steps, which are repeated in cycles (sprints) lasting 1-2 weeks:

1. **Product Backlog**  
   A prioritized list of features, enhancements, and bug fixes maintained by the Product Owner.
   If you are not such like situation, just create backlog own your self and than ask your manager that is this currect?

2. **Sprint Planning**  
   The team selects items from the Product Backlog to work on during the sprint. These items are added to the Sprint Backlog.
   If you are not such like situation, just wrote what your thought what are you doing this one to two weeks

3. **Sprint Backlog**  
   A list of tasks the team commits to completing during the sprint.
   Its role of Members so just do it.

4. **Sprint Execution**  
   The team works on the tasks in the Sprint Backlog. Daily Scrum meetings are held to ensure progress and address blockers.

5. **Potential Product Increment**  
   At the end of the sprint, the team delivers a potentially shippable product increment.

6. **Sprint Review**  
   The team demonstrates the completed work to stakeholders and gathers feedback.

## üîî Scrum Ceremonies

If you made or got backlog you have to know what is the first to do and what should we do
so we do plan

if it end we share what is the problem and what is good. we grow up

1. **Sprint Planning**  
   A meeting where the team decides what work will be done in the upcoming sprint.

2. **Daily Scrum**  
   A short, time-boxed meeting (15 minutes) where team members discuss progress, plans, and blockers.

3. **Sprint Review**  
   A meeting at the end of the sprint to showcase the completed work and gather feedback.

## üÜö Scrum vs. Traditional Waterfall

waterfall is not bad but its too hard change the plan
if you wanna agile move your project we can use scrum working process

1. **Waterfall**

   - Projects are planned in sequential phases (e.g., requirements, design, development, testing).
   - Each phase can take 3-6 months or more.
   - Changes are difficult to accommodate once a phase is completed.

2. **Scrum**
   - Work is divided into short sprints (1-4 weeks).
   - Continuous feedback and adaptability are key.
   - Changes can be incorporated at the start of each sprint.
