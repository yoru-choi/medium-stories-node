# The Future with AI: Human Capabilities and Job Transformation

## 1. Strengthening Uniquely Human Abilities üåç

As AI advances, capabilities that only humans excel at become increasingly important:

- **Creativity**: The ability to create art, design plans, and generate new ideas remains difficult for AI to fully replicate
- **Empathy & Emotional Intelligence**: Fields requiring emotional exchange between people‚Äîsuch as counseling, education, and nursing‚Äîremain fundamentally human-centered
- **Critical Thinking**: The ability to review information or systems generated by AI and suggest improvements remains crucial

## 2. Developing Skills for AI Collaboration ü§ñ

AI is a tool, not an adversary. What matters most is becoming a **"person who utilizes AI effectively"**.

Key skills include:

- **Prompt Engineering**: The ability to give clear instructions to AI and obtain desired results
- **AI Tool Proficiency**: Using tools like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and Notion AI to enhance productivity

## Jobs Likely to Decrease

Repetitive and routine tasks can be performed faster and more accurately by AI or robots:

- Office automation (e.g., data entry, accounting assistance)
- Call centers and customer service
- Driving (taxis, trucks once autonomous driving becomes mainstream)
- Simple manufacturing and logistics operations

These positions are targeted primarily for cost reduction and efficiency.

## Jobs Likely to Increase

- **AI-related professions**: Machine learning engineers, data scientists, prompt engineers
- **Human-machine collaboration managers**: Coordinators of work involving robots and AI
- **Digital wellbeing and psychological care**: Mental health services, technology addiction counseling

## Personal Reflection

I find some of these predictions hard to believe. I'm currently studying new technologies and AI, including MCP and Agent systems. People say Google is living 10 years in the future - I wonder what that future life at Google actually looks like.
